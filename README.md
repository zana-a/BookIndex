# Book Index

This program finds all the pages that a set of words occurs.

There is no main method nor main class so please use the `BookTest` class to run the tests which demonstrates that the
program is working.

In order to test, you can use the gradle wrapper.

Here is an example:

```sh
$./gradlew test
```
